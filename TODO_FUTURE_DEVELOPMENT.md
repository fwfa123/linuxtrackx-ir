- [ ] Create HTML-based help documentation
- [ ] Ensure help system works offline
- [ ] Add search functionality to help system

#### Qt6 Benefits
- Better Wayland support
- Improved performance
- Modern UI components
- Better accessibility
- Future-proof framework

## üçì Phase 4: Very High Complexity (Code Modernization)

### 4.1 C to C++ Migration (Module by Module)
**Priority: LOW | Effort: VERY HIGH | Impact: MEDIUM**

#### Gradual C++ Migration Strategy
- [ ] **Phase 4.1**: Start with utility modules
  - [ ] Convert `utils.c` to `utils.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `math_utils.c` to `math_utils.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `list.c` to `list.cpp`

- [ ] **Phase 4.2**: Core tracking modules
  - [ ] Convert `tracking.c` to `tracking.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `pose.c` to `pose.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `axis.c` to `axis.cpp`

- [ ] **Phase 4.3**: Device driver modules
  - [ ] Convert `tir_driver.c` to `tir_driver.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `tir4_driver.c` to `tir4_driver.cpp`
  - [ ] Convert `webcam_driver.c` to `webcam_driver.cpp`

- [ ] **Phase 4.4**: GUI and interface modules
  - [ ] Convert remaining C modules to C++
  - [ ] Implement proper C++ classes and inheritance

## üéØ Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on user-facing improvements first
2. **Test thoroughly**: Each phase should be fully tested before moving to next
3. **Maintain compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues to work
4. **Document changes**: Update documentation as you go
5. **User feedback**: Gather feedback from users for each phase

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for each module
- [ ] Integration tests for GUI changes
- [ ] Cross-distribution testing
- [ ] Hardware compatibility testing
- [ ] Wine compatibility testing

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Update README for each phase
- [ ] Create migration guides
- [ ] Update Wiki with new features
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Document breaking changes

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd linuxtrackx-ir

# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/qt-interface-upgrades

# Build current version
autoreconf -fiv
./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-debug
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Starting with Phase 1
1. **Begin with Wine/Steam Tab**: This provides immediate user value
2. **Focus on one feature at a time**: Don't try to do everything at once
3. **Test each change**: Ensure existing functionality isn't broken
4. **Document as you go**: Keep documentation updated

## üìù Notes

### Current State Analysis
- **Qt5 GUI**: Currently using Qt5 with some modern features
- **Build System**: Mix of autotools and basic CMake support
- **Code Base**: Primarily C with some C++ components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive but could be better organized

### Risk Assessment
- **Phase 1**: Low risk, high reward
- **Phase 2**: Medium risk, medium reward
- **Phase 3**: High risk, high reward
- **Phase 4**: Very high risk, long-term reward

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All phases maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] User experience improves with each phase
- [ ] Code becomes more maintainable
- [ ] Documentation remains comprehensive and accessible
