<h1>Tracking setup</h1>
<p>When you have the tracking device and model set up, then you can proceed to the tracking customization.</p>

<img src="Tracking.png" alt="Tracking setup pane.">

<p>Here you can set sensitivities, dead zones, nonlinearities and the amount of filtration for each axis separately; you can also turn unwanted axes off, specify limits of each axis and so on... All this can be done separately for each target program/game.</p>

<h2>Default profile</h2>
<p>The Default profile is quite special - when an unknown game/program is run for the first time, the Default profile is copied over as a base of the new profile.</p>

<h2>General setup</h2>
<p>Make sure you have selected the desired profile. Controls in the Tracking setup pane lets you do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check-box in the front allows you to enable/disable an axis.</li>
<li>Sensitivity controls allow you to change control responsiveness - the higher the sensitivity is, the more responsive the particular axis will be.</li>
<li>Check-box on the right side allows you to invert the axis response.</li>
<li><strong>Common smoothing</strong> slider allows you to set the amount of smoothing applied to all axes.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed axes setup</strong> button opens a dialog allowing you to set all aspects of all the axes.</li>
<li><strong>Import profile</strong> button imports all settings in the current profile from a file.</li>
<li><strong>Export profile</strong> button exports current profile to a file.</li>
<li><strong>Copy from Default Profile</strong> copies Default profile setup to the current profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the controls have immediate effect on the tracking, so you can directly see the impact of the change. Also note, that while it is possible to run ltr_gui in parallel with a client program/game, it is not recommended. The tracking does work without the GUI running, unlike other popular alternatives (NP, FreeTrack, FaceTrack NoIR...).</p>

<h2>Detailed axes setup</h2>
<p>When <strong>Detailed axes setup</strong> button is pressed, new dialog pops up allowing you to set all aspects of all axes.</p>

<img src="DetAxis.png" alt="Detailed axis setup.">

<p>On the left side you can see a visualization of the current axis and its setup. For both halves of an axis you can set an in-game limit of an axis and the curvature (nonlinearity) of the axis. There is a <strong>Symmetrical</strong> check-box that allows you to unchain those halves and set each one separately.</p>

<p>You can also set the axis sensitivity, dead-zone and the amount of additional filtration.</p>

<p>The higher the sensitivity is, the smaller head movement will be necessary for tracking. Just be careful not to set it too high - it might result in a stiff neck, and other problems.</p>

<p>Dead-zone allows you to specify size of the region around the center position, where the output is ignored.</p>

<p>Smoothing slider can be used to give the particular axis additional amount of smoothing.</p>
