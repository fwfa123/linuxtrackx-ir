<h1>NP Firmware Extractor</h1>
<p>Some NP devices (TrackIR4+ and SmartNav4) require a firmware that has to be loaded each time the device is started. Also the Linuxtrack-Wine bridge utilizes some informations contained in the package (the infamous poetry, list of supported games along with their IDs and keys for the "enhanced" interface). The firmware is extracted using Wine from the TrackIR windows package downloaded directly from NP.</p>

<h2>Firmware extraction</h2>
<img src="Extractor.png" alt="TrackIR firmware extractor.">

<p>When the Extraction dialog pops up, you will see instructions to download the latest TrackIR software from NaturalPoint's website. Please visit <a href="https://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/">https://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/</a> and download the latest version of the TrackIR software.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the TrackIR installer, use the <strong>Extract from installer</strong> button to select and process the downloaded file. A dialog containing short instructions will pop up. After pressing <strong>OK</strong> the package is installed to a temporary Wine prefix.</p>

<p>On Linux, usual installation dialog will pop up - just install the whole thing. Newer packages contain some MS runtime and NP USB drivers install, both of them has to be installed in order to install the main package. Don't worry though, none of the installed things is going to last - when the data are extracted, everything is going to be removed (and the installation happens in temporary Wine prefix).</p>

<p>On Macs, due to Wine configuration peculiarities, the installation should be performed silently.</p>

<p>When the installer finishes, the extraction is started - you can follow its progress in the status part of the Extractor dialog. When the extraction is finished, the dialog closes by itself.</p>

<p>If you don't have access to the Internet, you can download the TrackIR software from another computer and transfer it to this system, then use the <strong>Extract from installer</strong> button to find and open the downloaded file.</p>

<p>If you encounter any difficulties using the above methods, you can try to install the driver by hand (using Wine or install on windows machine and copy the result over). Then just press the <strong>Extract from unpacked</strong>, browse to the directory (the whole directory!) containing the NP software (e.g. ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/NaturalPoint/TrackIR5) and press <strong>Open</strong> button for the extraction to begin.</p>

<h2>Why so complicated?</h2>
<p>Maybe you wander, why is the whole thing that complicated, or why to download ~20MB package instead of 100KB one?</p>

<p>There are two main reasons that led to this decision:</p>

<p>The first one is the neglect from the NP's side - I asked couple of relatively simple questions (e.g. what is their take on Linuxtrack in Wine, ...), and after a year of waiting without any real answer, I came to a conclusion that this is not a way to go.</p>

<p>The second reason was their attempt to impose artificial limitations on the Linuxtrack itself in order to grant me a permission to use SmartNav 4 firmware; they asked for disabling SmartNav4 functionality on Mac OS, so people couldn't use Linuxtrack to emulate a mouse. Besides of being technically impossible to do (how a library can check what it is being used for), it would be completely against the Linuxtrack's spirit.</p>

<p>For those reasons (and couple of others) I decided to cut all the bonds (they used to host Linuxtrack firmware package in the past - per their own request) and using Wine was the only logical choice. Given the fact, that this step is mostly one time only, I hope the inconvenience level is not too high.</p>

<h2>Technical informations</h2>
<p>The extracted files are in the following path:</p>

<p>~/.config/linuxtrack/tir_firmware</p>

<p>and it contains the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>poem1.txt</strong> The first haiku verse - so called DLL signature</li>
<li><strong>poem2.txt</strong> The second haiku verse - so called Application signature</li>
<li><strong>gamedata.txt</strong> List of TrackIR enhanced games along with their IDs</li>
<li><strong>sn4.fw.gz</strong> SmartNav4 firmware</li>
<li><strong>tir4.fw.gz</strong> TrackIR4 firmware</li>
<li><strong>tir5.fw.gz</strong> TrackIR5 firmware</li>
<li><strong>tir5v2.fw.gz</strong> TrackIR5 rev 2 firmware</li>
</ul>

<p>The haiku verses are used by most games to verify that there is a TrackIR software on the other side. It was used to prevent other programs from emulating the interface (most notably FreeTrack). The claim was based on the fact, that those strings contain NP's trademark and they are copyrighted. My belief is, that since most games refuse to work without it, it is a part of the interface and therefore not copyright-able in order to provide means of interoperability. Also Fair use should be applicable in this case.</p>

<p>The gamedata.txt list is extracted from file sgl.dat; the file is encrypted using RC4 stream cipher, using first 5 bytes in MD5 hash of string "NaturalPoint" as a key. The payload is XML, containing data on supported games, of which the only relevant part is a game ID, its name and for games using the "enhanced" interface there are communication keys. The Linuxtrack-Wine bridge uses this info to determine game's name when passed its ID and the keys to emulate the enhanced interface when necessary.</p>
