  <h1>Welcome to Linuxtrack X-IR v0.99.22!</h1>
First of all, thank you for using Linuxtrack X-IR v0.99.22, a head-tracking software specifically tailored for Linux and supporting TrackIR devices.
  <p>
  Linuxtrack X-IR allows you to use your TrackIR device as a head-tracking device, facilitating view control
  in simulators (flight, racing) or any other type of software.
  <p>
  Among applications utilizing Linuxtrack X-IR are for example X-Plane flight simulator,
  Flight Gear flight simulator, and any TrackIR enabled game running in Wine (Condor soaring simulator,
  Il-2, Falcon 4, Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X, ARMA GOLD, ARMA 2).

  <p>
  Note: While the legacy code to support web-camera, Wiimote, and Mac OS is still present within the application, it may not be fully functional or tested. Future updates might address these aspects, but currently, my focus is on ensuring full compatibility with Linux and TrackIR devices.

  <p>
  Special thanks to UglyDwarf for creating Linuxtrack and making this incredible tool available.
  I am now maintaining LiinuxtrackX-IR with the goal of keeping it functional and up-to-date on modern Linux operating systems.

  Should you encounter a bug, please take a few minutes and file a bug report at the project page
  - it will allow me to fix the bug that is bothering you, and it also helps to improve LiinuxtrackX-IR itself.
  Also any comments, ideas for improvement and constructive criticism are very welcome!
