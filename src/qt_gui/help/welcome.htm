<h1>Welcome to Linuxtrack X-IR!</h1>
<p>First of all, thank you for using Linuxtrack X-IR, a modern fork of the original Linuxtrack head-tracking software for Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>Linuxtrack X-IR allows you to use a web-camera, wiimote or any of the supported NP devices (currently TrackIR2 to 5, SmartNav3 and SmartNav4) as a head-tracking device, facilitating view control in simulators (flight, racing) or any other type of software.</p>

<p>Among applications utilizing Linuxtrack X-IR are for example X-Plane flight simulator, Flight Gear flight simulator, and any TrackIR enabled game running in Wine (Microsoft Flight Simulator, DCS World, IL-2 Sturmovik, War Thunder, Elite Dangerous, Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator, ...).</p>

<p><strong>What's New in Linuxtrack X-IR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qt5 Modernization:</strong> Updated from Qt4 to Qt5 for modern Linux distributions</li>
<li><strong>Wine Compatibility:</strong> Enhanced Wine integration using winegcc for Windows games</li>
<li><strong>Modern Build System:</strong> Updated autotools and CMake support</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> PIE, stack protector, and fortify source enabled by default</li>
<li><strong>Active Development:</strong> Regular updates and community support</li>
</ul>
