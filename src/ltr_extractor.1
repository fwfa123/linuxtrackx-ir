.IX ltr_extractor
.SH NAME
ltr_extractor - extracts TrackIR/SmartNav firmware files and other necessary informations needed by Linuxtrack
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B ltr_extractor --extract | --update | --create [--blob] [--installer file] [--destination directory] [--spec file] file1 [file2 ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
ltr_extractor allows user to extract files necessary for Linuxtrack to utilize TrackIR/SmartNav devices.
These files are extracted from NaturalPoint's TrackIR software; the software itself can be installed using 
Wine (however it will not run), or can be copied from a Windows machine.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B --extract
Extracts firmware files, etc. from the files specified as the rest of arguments.
.TP
.B --create
For developer's usage - create signatures of files provided.
.TP
.B --update
When updated game identifiers are downloaded, this command decrypts the informations.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --spec file
Specify alternative spec file; when used with --extract, extraction uses this
.B file
instead of the default one. When used with --create, the data are written to the
.B file.

.TP
.B --blob
Instruct the extractor to create a blob or extract using it. Requires the installer argument.
.TP
.B --installer file
Instructs the extractor to use a particular installer
.B file
to create/unpack a blob.
.TP
.B --destination directory
Do not store extracted files in the default destination, but use the
.B directory 
to store the extracted files.


.SH Example of the recommended firmware extraction procedure
Download a TrackIR software installer and use the following command to extract the firmware:

.B ltr_extractor -e -b -i ~/Downloads/TrackIR_5.4.2.exe

If the blob file is not available for the installer you downloaded, you can proceed the
Wine way; install it the following way to a temporary Wine prefix:
 
.B mkdir /tmp/np
.br
.B WINEPREFIX=/tmp/np wine ~/Downloads/TrackIR_5.2.2.Final.exe

Just follow the instructions and install the software. When the software is installed, 
you can proceed to extraction:

.B ltr_extractor --extract \\\\
.br
.B /tmp/np/drive_c/Program\\\\ Files\\\\ \\\(x86\\\\)/NaturalPoint/TrackIR5/*

If all goes well, the necessary files are extracted. The above method also works if you
copy the unpacked TrackIR software directory from a Windows machine.

.SH Example of the blob creation
This expects the firmware is already installed by some other way (e.g. via Wine).

.B ltr_extractor -c -b -i ../TrackIR_5.4.2.exe $(find -L ~/.config/linuxtrack/tir_firmware -type f)

.SH Example of the spec creation
Command 

.B ltr_extractor --create --spec ./spec.txt poem1.txt poem2.txt tir4.fw

Prints signatures of files passed in; please note, that the firmware files have to be
ungzipped first. Results are written to the file spec.txt in the current directory.

.SH Example of the game files update
When using Linuxtrack in Wine, the game IDs and sometimes a communication keys are needed.
To download the update, use the following comand:

.B ltr_extractor --update

.SH Rationale
Most of the TrackIR devices need a firmware to work.
Soon after the first TrackIR device support was added, NaturalPoint chimed in, insisting
the firmware is their intellectual property, so it can't be distributed along with the
Linuxtrack itself. So the firmware files were packaged and the package was provided
to NaturalPoint and Linuxtrack used to download it from there.
Later on, after the SmartNav support was added, NaturalPoint requested that Linuxtrack
should limit its functionality on Mac platform; namely it shouldn't allow usage of SmartNav
as a virtual mouse. As there is no honest and/or reliable way to do that (library has no
means to find out what is it used for), the decision was made to stop relying on
NaturalPoint altogether.
.br
Currently there are several means of firmware (and several other files needed for Windows
games using the TrackIR) extraction:
.br
TrackIR installer is installed using Wine into a temporary prefix and the necessary files
are extracted from it. This method is probably the most general and it doesn't require a Windows
machine. Downsides are, that it requires user interaction, it is not very fast and last, but not
least it does require a Wine available (which proved problematic on Mac).
.br
If an user has access to a Windows machine, where the TrackIR software s installed, the
whole directory can be transferred to a machine with Linuxtrack, which can extract the 
files from it. You don't need Wine in this case, but the necessiry of having another machine with
Windows doesn't make it very convenient.
.br
The newest method uses binary "blobs", that when combined with the appropriate TrackIR software installer,
allow extraction of the necessary files. To be more precise, the blob itself is useless and without
the appropriate installer contains no usefull information. That way the original NaturalPoint's request
is respected (as they provide the installer), while having the benefit of needing no user interaction
and no Wine. The downside is that the blobs are roughly 250kB big and they need to be created for each
installer available.
