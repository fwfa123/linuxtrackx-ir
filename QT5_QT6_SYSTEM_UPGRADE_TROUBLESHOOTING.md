# LinuxTrack Qt5/Qt6 System Upgrade Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Critical Issue: System Upgrade Breaks Working LinuxTrack

### Problem Summary
After a successful LinuxTrack Qt5 modernization, a **system upgrade from Qt5 to Qt6** broke the working application. This guide documents the specific issues encountered and their complete resolution.

### Symptoms
- Previously working LinuxTrack Qt5 setup stops functioning after system upgrade
- Build system attempts to use Qt6 instead of Qt5
- Missing GUI executable (`ltr_gui` or `ltr_gui_qt5_debug`)
- Library symbol errors: `undefined symbol: v4l2_munmap`
- TrackIR device detected but access denied
- Configuration pointing to wrong directories

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Qt Version Mismatch
**Problem**: System upgrade installed Qt6 alongside Qt5, but changed default `qmake` to point to Qt6
**Impact**: LinuxTrack attempted to build with Qt6 libraries instead of intended Qt5
**Result**: Compilation failures and missing executables

### Secondary Issues Discovered
1. **Missing Executable**: Qt5 GUI executable was missing after attempted Qt6 build
2. **Library Symbol Errors**: `v4l2_munmap` errors in TrackIR libraries
3. **Permission Issues**: TrackIR device detected but access denied
4. **Hardcoded Prefix Paths**: Configuration pointing to build directory instead of project root

---

## 🛠️ Complete Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Qt5 Restoration and Verification

#### 1.1 Locate Qt5 qmake
```bash
# Find Qt5 qmake (should be installed alongside Qt6)
which qmake-qt5
# Expected: /usr/bin/qmake-qt5

# Verify Qt5 version
qmake-qt5 --version
# Expected: QMake version 3.1, Using Qt version 5.15.x
```

#### 1.2 Clean Qt6 Build Artifacts
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /mnt/Local_Git/git-repos/linuxtrack-clean-june14

# Clean previous build artifacts
make clean

# Remove Qt6-generated files
rm -f src/qt_gui/Makefile
rm -f src/qt_gui/ltr_gui
rm -f src/qt_gui/ltr_gui_qt5_debug
```

#### 1.3 Force Qt5 Rebuild
```bash
# Navigate to Qt GUI directory
cd src/qt_gui

# Regenerate Makefile using Qt5 qmake
qmake-qt5 ltr_gui.pro

# Build Qt5 GUI executable
make clean
make -j$(nproc)

# Verify executable was created
ls -la ltr_gui
# Expected: -rwxr-xr-x ... ltr_gui (approximately 23MB with debug symbols)
```

### Step 2: Launch Script Updates

#### 2.1 Fix Executable Name Reference
```bash
# Check current launch script
cat run_qt5_gui.sh | grep -E "(ltr_gui|exec)"

# Update to use correct executable name
sed -i 's/ltr_gui_qt5_debug/ltr_gui/g' run_qt5_gui.sh

# Verify launch script is executable
chmod +x run_qt5_gui.sh
```

#### 2.2 Test Launch Script
```bash
# Test launch script
./run_qt5_gui.sh

# Expected: Qt5 GUI launches successfully
# Expected log: Process ID, memory usage (e.g., Process 27210, 244MB RAM)
```

### Step 3: Configuration File Corrections

#### 3.1 Fix Hardcoded Prefix Paths
```bash
# Check current configuration
cat ~/.config/linuxtrack/linuxtrack1.conf | grep Prefix

# Should be project root, not build subdirectory
# Correct: Prefix = "/mnt/Local_Git/git-repos/linuxtrack-clean-june14"
# Wrong: Prefix = "/mnt/Local_Git/git-repos/linuxtrack-clean-june14/src/qt_gui"

# Fix if necessary
sed -i 's|Prefix = ".*/src/qt_gui"|Prefix = "/mnt/Local_Git/git-repos/linuxtrack-clean-june14"|' ~/.config/linuxtrack/linuxtrack1.conf
```

#### 3.2 Fix Source Code Hardcoded Paths
```bash
# Check for hardcoded paths in source
grep -r "ltr_gui/" src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.pro

# Fix hardcoded HELP_BASE path
sed -i 's|HELP_BASE=\\"ltr_gui/\\"|HELP_BASE=\\"../\\"|' src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.pro
```

### Step 4: Complete Rebuild with Corrections

#### 4.1 Final Rebuild
```bash
# Navigate to Qt GUI directory
cd src/qt_gui

# Clean and rebuild with corrected paths
make clean
qmake-qt5 ltr_gui.pro
make -j$(nproc)

# Verify final executable
ls -la ltr_gui
```

#### 4.2 Verify TrackIR Detection
```bash
# Launch application
./run_qt5_gui.sh

# Check for TrackIR detection in logs
# Expected: "Found device 8", "Device is a TrackIR (131D:0159)"
```

---

## 🧪 Verification and Testing

### Hardware Verification
```bash
# Verify TrackIR 5 hardware detection
lsusb | grep "131d:0159"
# Expected: Bus 001 Device 002: ID 131d:0159 Natural Point TrackIR 5

# Check device permissions
ls -la /dev/bus/usb/001/002
# Expected: crw-rw-rw- (world readable/writable)
```

### Software Verification
```bash
# Check Qt5 GUI process
ps aux | grep ltr_gui
# Expected: GUI process running with reasonable memory usage

# Check library loading
ldd src/qt_gui/ltr_gui | grep "not found"
# Expected: No "not found" libraries
```

### TrackIR Functionality Test
```bash
# Test TrackIR activation
# 1. Launch GUI: ./run_qt5_gui.sh
# 2. Select TrackIR input device
# 3. Click START button
# 4. Verify TrackIR LEDs light up
# 5. Check for real-time tracking data
```

## 🔧 Prevention and Maintenance

### System Upgrade Best Practices

#### Before System Upgrades
```bash
# Document current working Qt version
qmake --version > qt_version_backup.txt

# Backup working configuration
cp ~/.config/linuxtrack/linuxtrack1.conf ~/.config/linuxtrack/linuxtrack1.conf.backup

# Create working executable backup
cp src/qt_gui/ltr_gui src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.backup
```

#### After System Upgrades
```bash
# Verify Qt version hasn't changed
qmake --version

# If Qt6 is now default, force Qt5 usage
export QT_SELECT=qt5
# Or use explicit qmake-qt5 commands
```

### Environment Variables for Qt5 Preference
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or project-specific scripts
export QT_SELECT=qt5
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"  # Ensure qmake-qt5 is found

# For LinuxTrack-specific environment
echo 'export QT_SELECT=qt5' >> ~/.linuxtrack_env
echo 'source ~/.linuxtrack_env' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## 📋 Lessons Learned

### Key Insights
1. **System upgrades can break working applications** by changing default tool versions
2. **Qt5/Qt6 coexistence requires explicit version selection** via qmake-qt5
3. **Hardcoded paths in source code cause configuration issues** across different setups
4. **Missing executables often indicate build system problems** rather than code issues
5. **TrackIR permission errors can mask underlying library/build problems**

### Future-Proofing Recommendations
1. **Always use explicit Qt5 commands** (`qmake-qt5` instead of `qmake`)
2. **Document working environment** before system upgrades
3. **Use relative paths in configuration** instead of absolute paths where possible
4. **Implement build system checks** to verify Qt version before building
5. **Create automated test scripts** to verify functionality after changes
