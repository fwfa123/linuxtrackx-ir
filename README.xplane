# X-Plane Plugin Support

Linuxtrack package contains two plugins for X-Plane simulator:

- **xlinuxtrack.so.0** - Legacy plugin for X-Plane v8.XX and v9.XX
- **xlinuxtrack9.so.0** - Current plugin for X-Plane v9.XX and newer versions

## Requirements

To build X-Plane plugins, you need the **X-Plane SDK**:

1. **Download**: Get the SDK from [Laminar Research Developer Site](https://developer.x-plane.com/sdk/plugin-sdk-downloads/)
2. **Install**: Extract to `/usr/include/xplane_sdk/` or specify custom path during configure
3. **Configure**: Use `--with-xplane-sdk=/path/to/sdk` if not in default location

## Installation

The xlinuxtrack9 plugin is installed by default when X-Plane SDK is available during build.

## Usage

After installation, the plugin will be available in X-Plane's plugin manager for head tracking support.
