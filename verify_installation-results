  → Run: sudo make install-udev-rules
  → Or manually copy rules to /lib/udev/rules.d/
  → Run: sudo udevadm control --reload-rules

• Desktop integration missing:
  → Run: make install-desktop
  → Run: update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
  → Run: gtk-update-icon-cache -f -t ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor

• Permission issues:
  → Add user to plugdev group: sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
  → Log out and log back in for group changes to take effect

• Missing dependencies:
  → Install Qt5: sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools
  → Install OpenCV: sudo apt install libopencv-dev
  → Install other deps: sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libmxml-dev

Warnings can usually be ignored but may affect functionality.
