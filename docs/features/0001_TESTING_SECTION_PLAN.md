# Testing Section for Gaming Tab - Technical Plan

**Feature Number**: 0001  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: PLANNING

---

## üìã Feature Description

Add a Testing section to the Gaming Tab that allows users to select and run either Tester.exe or FT_Tester (FreeTrack Tester) in any available wine prefixes. The system will leverage existing game discovery and sorting logic from the wine bridge installers to present users with available games across Steam, Lutris, and Custom Prefix platforms.

---

## üéØ Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Tester Selection**: Allow users to choose between Tester.exe (TrackIR) or FT_Tester (FreeTrack)
2. **Automatic Tracking**: Start tracking immediately when user begins testing workflow
3. **Platform Selection**: Present Steam, Lutris, and Custom Prefix as platform options
4. **Game Discovery**: Use existing game discovery logic to show available games for selected platform
5. **Prefix Execution**: Execute selected tester in the correct wine prefix for chosen game
6. **Future Expansion**: Design to accommodate additional platforms beyond current three

### User Workflow
1. User selects desired tester (Tester.exe or FT_Tester)
2. **System automatically starts tracking** (same as existing wine bridge installation workflow)
3. User selects platform (Steam, Lutris, Custom Prefix)
4. System displays available games for selected platform using existing discovery logic
5. User selects specific game
6. **System checks for testers in selected prefix**
7. **If testers missing**: Offer user option to install Wine Bridge or cancel
8. **If testers found**: Execute selected tester in the correct wine prefix for that game

## üîß Implementation Components

### Files to Modify

#### UI Components
- `src/qt_gui/ltr.ui` - Add Testing section to Gaming Tab layout
- `src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.cpp` - Add Testing section button handlers
- `src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.h` - Add Testing section class members

#### Testing Logic
- `src/qt_gui/plugin_install.cpp` - Add tester execution methods
- `src/qt_gui/plugin_install.h` - Add tester execution method declarations
- `src/qt_gui/steam_integration.cpp` - Reuse Steam game discovery logic
- `src/qt_gui/lutris_integration.cpp` - Reuse Lutris game discovery logic

#### Wine Bridge Integration
- `src/wine_bridge/ltr_wine.nsi.in` - Reference existing tester installation paths
- `src/wine_bridge/ltr_wine64.nsi.in` - Reference existing 64-bit tester paths

### New Files to Create
- `src/qt_gui/testing_section.cpp` - Main testing section implementation
- `src/qt_gui/testing_section.h` - Testing section interface
- `src/qt_gui/tester_launcher.cpp` - Tester execution logic
- `src/qt_gui/tester_launcher.h` - Tester launcher interface

## üéÆ Platform Integration Strategy

### Steam Proton Integration
- **Game Discovery**: Reuse existing Steam library parsing from `steam_integration.cpp`
- **Prefix Detection**: Use existing Steam Proton prefix detection logic
- **Tester Location**: Look for testers in Steam Proton prefix directories
- **Environment Setup**: Use existing Steam Proton environment configuration

### Lutris Integration
- **Game Discovery**: Reuse existing Lutris game detection from `lutris_integration.cpp`
- **Wine Version**: Use existing Lutris Wine version detection logic
- **Prefix Path**: Use existing Lutris prefix path construction
- **Environment Setup**: Configure Lutris-specific Wine environment

### Custom Prefix Integration
- **Manual Selection**: Allow user to browse and select custom wine prefix
- **Tester Detection**: Search for testers in user-selected prefix
- **Environment Setup**: Use system Wine or user-specified Wine version
- **Validation**: Verify prefix contains required tester executables

---

## üîç Tester Detection Algorithm

### Tester File Locations
1. **Primary Location**: Wine prefix root directory (where NSIS installer placed testers)
2. **Secondary Location**: Common Windows program directories within prefix
3. **Fallback Location**: System-wide wine bridge installation directories

### Detection Process
1. **Prefix Validation**: Verify selected wine prefix exists and is valid
2. **Tester Search**: Search for Tester.exe/Tester64.exe or FT_Tester.exe in prefix
3. **Missing Tester Handling**: If testers not found, offer user option to install Wine Bridge
4. **Version Detection**: Determine if 32-bit or 64-bit testers are available
5. **Path Construction**: Build full path to tester executable
6. **Execution Validation**: Verify tester is executable and can be launched

---

## üéØ UI Design Strategy

### Testing Section Layout
- **Section Header**: "Testing" with clear description
- **Tester Selection**: Radio buttons for Tester.exe vs FT_Tester
- **Platform Selection**: Dropdown or buttons for Steam/Lutris/Custom
- **Game List**: Scrollable list of available games for selected platform
- **Execute Button**: Launch selected tester in chosen game's prefix

### User Experience Flow
1. **Clear Workflow**: Step-by-step selection process
2. **Automatic Tracking**: Tracking starts immediately when testing begins
3. **Visual Feedback**: Show selected options and current step
4. **Missing Tester Handling**: Offer Wine Bridge installation when testers not found
5. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for missing testers or invalid prefixes
6. **Progress Indication**: Show when tester is launching
7. **Result Feedback**: Indicate successful launch or error conditions

## üîç Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Tester Location**: Testers may not be found in expected locations
- **Missing Wine Bridge**: Selected prefix may not have Wine Bridge installed
- **Wine Environment**: Different wine versions may affect tester execution
- **Platform Differences**: Steam Proton vs Lutris vs Custom may have different requirements
- **Permission Issues**: Wine prefix access permissions may prevent tester execution

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Search**: Search multiple locations for tester executables
- **Missing Tester Detection**: Check for testers before attempting execution
- **Wine Bridge Installation Offer**: Provide immediate option to install Wine Bridge when testers missing
- **Environment Validation**: Verify wine environment before launching testers
- **Platform-Specific Logic**: Handle each platform's unique requirements
- **Permission Checking**: Verify prefix access before attempting execution
- **Fallback Options**: Provide alternative execution methods if primary fails
