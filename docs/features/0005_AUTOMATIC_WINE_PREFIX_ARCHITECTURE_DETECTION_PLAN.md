# Automatic Wine Prefix Architecture Detection for Tester Execution - Technical Plan

**Feature Number**: 0005  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: PLANNING

---

## üìã Feature Description

Enhance the Gaming tab's RunTesterButton functionality to automatically detect the wine prefix architecture and run the corresponding 32-bit or 64-bit tester executable. Currently, the system only checks the tester filename to determine architecture, but should intelligently detect the actual prefix architecture and select the appropriate tester from the installed files (both 32-bit and 64-bit testers are installed during wine bridge NSIS installation).

---

## üéØ Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Automatic Architecture Detection**: Detect wine prefix architecture without relying on tester filename
2. **Intelligent Tester Selection**: Choose between Tester.exe (32-bit) and Tester64.exe (64-bit) based on detected architecture
3. **Environment Optimization**: Set appropriate WINEARCH environment variable based on detected architecture
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work with Steam Proton, Lutris, and Custom Prefix platforms
5. **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handle unclear architecture detection scenarios

### User Experience Goals
- **Zero-Configuration Testing**: Users don't need to know about wine architecture differences
- **Automatic Optimization**: System automatically selects the best tester for the prefix
- **Clear Feedback**: Users understand which tester was selected and why
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing testing workflow without disruption

## üß† Implementation Algorithm

### Phase 1: Architecture Detection
1. **Environment Variable Check**: Look for existing WINEARCH in prefix context
2. **Directory Structure Analysis**: Examine prefix for architecture indicators
   - Check for `drive_c/windows/syswow64` (64-bit indicator)
   - Compare `drive_c/windows/system32` vs `drive_c/windows/syswow64` DLLs
   - Examine `system.reg` file for architecture-specific entries
3. **Wine Command Detection**: Run `wine --version` with prefix to determine wine architecture
4. **Registry Analysis**: Parse wine registry for architecture indicators

### Phase 2: Tester Selection
1. **Architecture-Based Selection**:
   - 32-bit prefix ‚Üí Tester.exe
   - 64-bit prefix ‚Üí Tester64.exe
2. **Fallback Strategy**: If architecture unclear, try both testers and let wine decide
3. **Compatibility Validation**: Verify selected tester works with detected architecture
4. **User Feedback**: Inform user which tester was selected and reasoning

### Phase 3: Environment Setup
1. **WINEARCH Configuration**: Set appropriate WINEARCH based on detection
2. **Prefix Environment**: Configure WINEPREFIX and working directory
3. **Platform Integration**: Preserve platform-specific environment variables
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle environment setup failures

### Phase 4: Execution and Monitoring
1. **Tester Launch**: Execute selected tester with optimized environment
2. **Process Monitoring**: Track tester execution and capture output
3. **Error Reporting**: Provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
4. **Success Validation**: Confirm tester launched successfully

## üîç Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Reliable Architecture Detection
**Problem**: Wine prefixes may have mixed or unclear architecture indicators
**Solution**: Multi-layered detection approach with fallback strategies
- Primary: Directory structure analysis
- Secondary: Wine command output parsing
- Tertiary: Registry analysis
- Fallback: Let wine default to appropriate architecture

### Challenge 2: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Problem**: Different platforms (Steam, Lutris, Custom) have different wine setups
**Solution**: Platform-specific detection logic with common interface
- Steam: Leverage existing Proton integration
- Lutris: Use Lutris-specific wine version detection
- Custom: System wine with prefix analysis

### Challenge 3: Tester Availability
**Problem**: Testers may be missing or corrupted in some prefixes
**Solution**: Comprehensive validation and fallback mechanisms
- Check for both 32-bit and 64-bit testers
- Validate file integrity and permissions
- Offer wine bridge installation if testers missing
- Provide clear error messages and next steps

### Challenge 4: Performance Impact
**Problem**: Architecture detection adds overhead to tester execution
**Solution**: Optimized detection algorithms and caching
- Cache detection results for repeated use
- Minimize file system operations
- Use efficient wine command execution
- Implement timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
