## 0003 – Gaming Tab UI Improvements: Code Review

### Summary
- Prerequisite gating (TIR firmware + MFC42) is implemented in `ltr.ui`, wired in `ltr_gui.cpp`, and signaled from `PluginInstall`.
- Installer section mostly matches plan; an "Advanced..." `QToolButton` is present; legacy advanced buttons are hidden by default.
- Testing section auto-load, persistence with `QSettings`, status label, filter, and progress bar are implemented in `TestingSection`.
- Steam/Lutris/Wine icons were added to `ltr_rc.qrc`.

Overall, the plan has been implemented with a few correctness and polish issues outlined below.

### Correctness issues (fix soon)
- UI in background thread (critical): `TestingSection::loadGamesForPlatform()` spawns a background task but may call UI from it when platform is "Custom Prefix" (`getCustomPrefixGames()` uses `QFileDialog` and `QMessageBox`). UI must run on the main thread.
  - Suggested: Do not run the "Custom Prefix" path inside `QtConcurrent::run`. Execute that path on the GUI thread and only thread off Steam/Lutris game discovery.
- Premature status/progress updates: In both `onPlatformSelectionChanged()` and `onLoadGamesClicked()` the code sets the final status text and hides the progress bar immediately after starting the async load. This produces flicker and misleading messages.
  - Suggested: Only update final status and hide the progress bar in the `QFutureWatcher::finished` handler where results are available.

### i18n and data-alignment
- Hard-coded platform text comparisons: Logic branches on exact strings ("Steam", "Lutris", "Custom Prefix"). If these UI strings are translated, logic will break.
  - Suggested: Store a stable key (e.g., `steam`, `lutris`, `custom`) in `QComboBox` itemData and branch on that, or use an enum.
- Programmatic strings are not wrapped with `tr()`: Many user-visible strings in `plugin_install.cpp`, `testing_section.cpp`, and `ltr_gui.cpp` use `QString::fromUtf8()` literals. The plan called out translation readiness.
  - Suggested: Wrap all user-facing messages in `tr()` (or the appropriate QObject context) and run them through Qt Linguist.

### Resources and UI polish
- Icon resource paths mismatch: `ltr_gui.cpp` loads `:/ltr/steam.svg`, `:/ltr/lutris.svg`, `:/ltr/wine.svg`, but `ltr_rc.qrc` lists them under `ltr/icons/*.svg`. As a result, icons won’t appear.
  - Suggested: Use `:/ltr/icons/steam.svg`, `:/ltr/icons/lutris.svg`, `:/ltr/icons/wine.svg`.
- Advanced actions duplication: `OtherPlatformButton` and `WinePrefixButton` remain in the grid (hidden) while an "Advanced..." menu provides the same actions.
  - Suggested: Keep only the menu (as per plan) and remove the hidden buttons in a follow-up cleanup.

### Plan compliance checklist
- Prerequisites group with status + action buttons
  - Implemented: `PrereqGroupBox` with `FirmwareStatusLabel`/`MfcStatusLabel` and `FirmwareActionButton`/`MfcActionButton`.
  - Gating: `LinuxtrackGui::setGamingControlsEnabled()` disables installers and the Testing group based on `PluginInstall` checks. `prereqStatusChanged(bool)` wired.
- Installer grouping and copy consistency
  - Partially implemented: Grid retained; consistent tooltips and accessible names added; Advanced menu present; X-Plane plugin kept separate.
- Testing section improvements
  - Implemented: Auto-load on platform change; status label; optional filter; persistence of last platform/game via `QSettings`; run button enablement.
  - Needs fixes: Async status/progress handling; custom prefix path threading.
- Visual polish and accessibility
  - Implemented: Button min widths, accessible names, tooltips; icons added (path bug outstanding).
  - Localization: Pending (strings not yet using `tr()`).

### Notable code references
- Prereq gating and signal wiring: `src/qt_gui/ltr_gui.cpp` (`refreshGamingPrereqStatus`, `setGamingControlsEnabled`, connections to `PluginInstall::prereqStatusChanged`).
- Prereq checks/emission: `src/qt_gui/plugin_install.h/.cpp` (`isTirFirmwareInstalled`, `isMfc42uInstalled`, `prereqStatusChanged`).
- Testing workflow and async load: `src/qt_gui/testing_section.cpp` (setup, platform change, load, filter, persistence).
- Resources: `src/qt_gui/ltr_rc.qrc` (`icons/steam.svg`, `icons/lutris.svg`, `icons/wine.svg`).
- UI layout: `src/qt_gui/ltr.ui` (`PrereqGroupBox`, installer grid, Testing group with filter/status/progress).

### Actionable recommendations
1) Fix UI-on-thread issue in Testing section (Custom Prefix path) and centralize UI updates to the `finished` handler only.
   - Done in `testing_section.cpp`.
2) Replace hard-coded platform text comparisons with stable keys or an enum; decouple UI labels from logic.
   - Implemented platform key helpers in `testing_section.{h,cpp}` and switched logic to keys.
3) Wrap user-visible strings in `tr()` across `plugin_install.cpp`, `testing_section.cpp`, and `ltr_gui.cpp`.
   - Applied to Testing and key installer dialogs; remaining strings to sweep later.
4) Correct icon resource paths in `ltr_gui.cpp` to match `ltr_rc.qrc`.
   - Done.
5) Optional cleanup: Remove hidden advanced buttons from the grid and rely solely on the Advanced menu.
   - Removed `OtherPlatformButton` and `WinePrefixButton` from `ltr.ui`; kept `AdvancedButton` menu.

### Nice-to-haves (later)
- Add busy indicator semantics (disable controls in Testing area during async loads) and guard against re-entrancy.
- Unit/integration tests for Steam/Lutris discovery adapters where feasible.
