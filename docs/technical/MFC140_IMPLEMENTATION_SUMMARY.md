## Technical Implementation Details

### Installation Methods

#### Method 1: Winetricks Installation (Recommended)
```bash
winetricks vcrun2015 vcrun2017 vcrun2019 vcrun2022
```

#### Method 2: Package Manager Installation
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu/MX
sudo apt install wine-staging wine32:i386

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install wine-staging wine-core wine-desktop

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S wine-staging wine-mono wine-gecko
```

#### Method 3: Direct Redistributable Installation
- Download Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable from Microsoft
- Install in Wine prefix
- Extract MFC140 libraries

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- MFC42 extractor class remains functional
- Wine bridge falls back to MFC42 if MFC140 is not available
- Existing MFC42 installations continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Legal Compliance

- **Eliminates Copyright Issues**: No more Microsoft MFC42 copyright concerns
- **Redistributable Libraries**: Visual C++ 2015-2022 MFC is legally redistributable
- **Modern Licensing**: Uses current Microsoft licensing terms
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive legal compliance documentation provided

## Testing Results
