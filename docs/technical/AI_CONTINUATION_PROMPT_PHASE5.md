## 🔧 Recent Fixes and Improvements

### **✅ Wine Bridge Crash Issue - RESOLVED**
**Problem**: `linuxtrack-wine.exe` was crashing with Wine error during installation:
```
Unhandled exception: page fault on read access to 0x00000000 in wow64 32-bit code
```

**Root Cause**: AppImage was using old pre-built `linuxtrack-wine.exe` from `prebuilt/wine_bridge/` instead of building fresh from source.

**Solution**: Updated build script to:
1. **Build Wine bridge components from source** during AppImage build
2. **Use freshly built `linuxtrack-wine.exe`** instead of pre-built version
3. **Copy from build directory** to correct AppImage locations

**Result**: Wine bridge installer now works correctly without crashes.

### **✅ Build Process Optimization**
- **Self-contained build**: AppImage now builds Wine bridge components from source
- **Correct component placement**: Wine bridge installer placed in all required GUI paths
- **Fresh builds**: No dependency on potentially outdated pre-built components
