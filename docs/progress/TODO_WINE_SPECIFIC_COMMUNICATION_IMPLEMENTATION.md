# üîß Wine-Specific Communication Implementation TODO

**Branch**: `feature/wine-prefix-tester-integration`  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## üìã Overview

**PROBLEM**: The current Wine Bridge tries to dynamically load Linux libraries from within Wine, which doesn't work. The old version worked because it had a different approach.

**SOLUTION**: Implement a Wine-specific communication approach that doesn't rely on dynamic library loading.

---

## üéØ Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Wine-Compatible IPC**: Direct socket communication from Wine Bridge to LinuxTrack master
2. **Automatic TrackIR Control**: TrackIR device starts/stops automatically with Wine Bridge apps
3. **No Dynamic Loading**: Avoid dynamic library loading that doesn't work in Wine
4. **Process Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when Wine Bridge applications exit

### User Experience Goals
- **Automatic Start**: TrackIR starts when Tester.exe or games launch
- **Automatic Stop**: TrackIR stops when Tester.exe or games close
- **UI Feedback**: LinuxTrack UI shows correct tracking state
- **Clean Exit**: No orphaned processes left running

---

## üîß Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Wine-Specific Socket Communication
**Files to Modify:**
- `src/wine_bridge/client/NPClient_main.c` - Add Wine-compatible socket communication
- `src/wine_bridge/ft_client/FreeTrackClient_main.c` - Add similar communication

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Direct Socket Implementation**: Use Wine's socket support directly
2. **Unix Domain Sockets**: Communicate with LinuxTrack master via `/tmp/ltr_m_sock`
3. **Command Protocol**: Send CMD_WAKEUP (3) and CMD_PAUSE (2) commands
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when socket communication fails

### Phase 2: Process Management
**Implementation:**
1. **DLL Cleanup**: Register cleanup handlers in DLL_PROCESS_DETACH
2. **Resource Management**: Proper socket cleanup and resource management
3. **Multiple Instances**: Handle multiple Wine Bridge instances properly

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
**Testing:**
1. **Tester.exe Integration**: Test automatic start/stop with Tester.exe
2. **Game Integration**: Test with Steam Proton games
3. **Error Scenarios**: Test when LinuxTrack master is not running
4. **Performance**: Ensure no performance impact
