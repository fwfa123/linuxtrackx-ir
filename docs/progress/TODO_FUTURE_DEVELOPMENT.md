## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd linuxtrackx-ir

# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/qt-interface-upgrades

# Build current version
autoreconf -fiv
./configure --prefix=/opt --enable-debug
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Recommended configure for multi-arch (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-lib32-dir=i386-linux-gnu --enable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
```

### Starting with Phase 1
1. **Begin with Wine/Steam Tab**: This provides immediate user value
2. **Focus on one feature at a time**: Don't try to do everything at once
