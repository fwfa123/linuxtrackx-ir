# üß™ Wine Prefix Tester Integration TODO

**Branch**: `feature/wine-prefix-tester-integration`  
**Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Status**: PLANNING

---

## üìã Overview

This feature integrates Tester.exe/Tester64.exe execution directly into the NSIS installer workflow, automatically launching the tester immediately after Wine Bridge installation completes. This provides seamless TrackIR device verification across all gaming platforms (Steam Proton, Lutris, Custom Prefix) without requiring additional user interaction.

## üéØ Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Automatic Testing**: Launch Tester.exe/Tester64.exe automatically after NSIS installation
2. **Seamless Integration**: Integrate testing into existing installation workflow
3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work with Steam Proton, Lutris, and Custom Prefixes
4. **Immediate Validation**: Provide instant TrackIR device verification

### User Experience Goals
- **Zero-Click Testing**: Automatic testing without user interaction
- **Seamless Workflow**: Installation ‚Üí Testing happens automatically
- **Clear Results**: Understandable feedback about TrackIR detection
- **Platform Agnostic**: Same experience across all gaming platforms
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of testing failures

---

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **NSIS Integration**: Modify NSIS installer to launch Tester.exe/Tester64.exe at completion
2. **Automatic Execution**: Launch tester in the same environment as NSIS installer
3. **User Interaction**: Let user interact directly with Tester.exe/Tester64.exe UI
4. **Error Handling**: Handle missing files, execution failures, etc.

### Simplified Implementation Approach
Since the Tester executables are already installed to the Wine prefix during the NSIS installation process, and we're leveraging the existing NSIS installer environment, our implementation is extremely simplified:

- **Perfect Environment**: Already in correct Wine/Proton environment with all variables set
- **No Additional Setup**: No need to recreate environment or manage processes
- **Automatic Execution**: Tester launches immediately after installation completes
- **Seamless Integration**: Part of the existing installation workflow
- **Cross-Platform**: Works with Steam Proton, Lutris, and Custom Prefixes automatically

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Steam Proton
- **Environment Variables**: Use same environment as NSIS installer
- **Proton Integration**: Launch tester within Proton environment
- **Prefix Detection**: Use Steam Proton prefix detection logic

#### Lutris
- **Wine Version**: Use Lutris-specific Wine version
- **Prefix Path**: Use Lutris prefix detection logic
- **Environment Setup**: Configure Lutris-specific environment

#### Custom Prefix
- **Direct Wine**: Use system Wine or specified Wine version
- **Prefix Path**: Use user-selected prefix path
- **Environment Variables**: Set up basic Wine environment

## üìÅ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: NSIS Integration

#### 1.1 NSIS Installer Modification
**Files to Modify:**
- `src/wine_bridge/installer/linuxtrack-wine.nsi` - Add tester execution
- `src/wine_bridge/installer/linuxtrack-wine64.nsi` - Add tester execution for 64-bit

**Implementation:**
```nsis
; Add to NSIS installer at the end
Section "Post-Installation Testing"
    ; Launch Tester.exe from installed location
    ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\Tester.exe"'
    ; Or for 64-bit: ExecWait '"$INSTDIR\Tester64.exe"'
    
    ; Capture exit code and return to Qt
    SetOutPath $TEMP
    FileOpen $0 "$TEMP\tester_result.txt" w
    FileWrite $0 $R0  ; Exit code
    FileClose $0
SectionEnd
```

#### 1.2 Automatic Tester Launch
**Files to Modify:**
- `src/wine_bridge/installer/linuxtrack-wine.nsi` - Add tester execution
- `src/wine_bridge/installer/linuxtrack-wine64.nsi` - Add tester execution for 64-bit

**Implementation:**
```nsis
; Add to NSIS installer at the end
Section "Post-Installation Testing"
    ; Launch Tester.exe from installed location
    Exec '"$INSTDIR\Tester.exe"'
    ; Or for 64-bit: Exec '"$INSTDIR\Tester64.exe"'
SectionEnd
```

## üîç Technical Challenges

### 1. Tester Executable Location
**Challenge**: Finding Tester.exe/Tester64.exe in Wine prefix after NSIS installation
**Solution**: 
- Tester executables are already installed to the Wine prefix during NSIS installation
- Look for Tester.exe/Tester64.exe in the Wine prefix directory
- Use the same prefix path where Wine Bridge was installed
- No need to search system directories - testers are prefix-specific

### 2. NSIS Integration
**Challenge**: Modifying NSIS installer to launch tester automatically
**Solution**:
- Add tester execution to NSIS installer script
- Use ExecWait to launch Tester.exe/Tester64.exe
- Capture exit code and output
- Handle both 32-bit and 64-bit testers

### 3. Automatic Launch
**Challenge**: Launching tester automatically after NSIS installation
**Solution**:
- Use Exec command in NSIS to launch Tester.exe/Tester64.exe
- Launch in same environment as NSIS installer
- Let user interact directly with tester UI
- No need to capture or parse results

### 4. User Experience
**Challenge**: Providing seamless testing experience
**Solution**:
- Tester launches automatically after installation
- User interacts directly with tester's built-in UI
