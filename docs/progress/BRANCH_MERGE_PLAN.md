  - Qt6 compatibility fixes
  - Enhanced Wayland support
  - Ubuntu/Debian build compatibility
  - Comprehensive documentation
- **Latest Commit**: `e15137b` - Add comprehensive installation analysis document
- **Status**: Ready for merge

## üîÑ Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Merge `installation-system-completion` into `feature/usb-modernization-safe`
**Priority**: High (Contains core Qt5 migration work)

**Steps**:
1. Switch to `feature/usb-modernization-safe`
2. Merge `installation-system-completion`
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Test integration
5. Commit merge

**Expected Benefits**:
- Complete Qt5 migration integration
- Professional installation system
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Complete documentation

### Phase 2: Merge `trackir2winebridge` into `feature/usb-modernization-safe`
**Priority**: Medium (Additional features and compatibility)

**Steps**:
1. Ensure Phase 1 merge is stable
2. Merge `trackir2winebridge`
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Test integration
5. Commit merge

**Expected Benefits**:
- Qt6 compatibility
- Enhanced Wayland support
- Additional build compatibility
- Extended documentation

### Phase 3: Final Integration and Testing
**Priority**: High (Quality assurance)

**Steps**:
1. Comprehensive testing of merged codebase
2. Verify all features work together
3. Update documentation
4. Prepare for main branch promotion

## üõ†Ô∏è Merge Process

### Step 1: Prepare for Merge
```bash
# Ensure we're on the target branch
git checkout feature/usb-modernization-safe

# Update target branch
git pull origin feature/usb-modernization-safe  # if remote exists
```

### Step 2: Merge installation-system-completion
```bash
# Merge the installation system branch
git merge installation-system-completion

# Resolve any conflicts
# Test the integration
# Commit if successful
```

### Step 3: Merge trackir2winebridge
```bash
# Merge the wine bridge branch
git merge trackir2winebridge

# Resolve any conflicts
# Test the integration
# Commit if successful
```

### Step 4: Final Integration
```bash
# Comprehensive testing
# Update documentation
# Prepare for main branch promotion
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Conflicts and Resolutions

### Expected Conflict Areas:
1. **Documentation Files**: Multiple branches may have updated the same docs
2. **Build Configuration**: Different branches may have different build settings
3. **Installation Scripts**: May have overlapping installation logic

### Conflict Resolution Strategy:
1. **Documentation**: Merge content, avoid duplication
2. **Build Config**: Prefer the most complete/working configuration
3. **Installation**: Integrate features from both branches

## üéØ Success Criteria

### After Phase 1 (installation-system-completion merge):
- [ ] Qt5 migration fully integrated
- [ ] Professional installation system working
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

### After Phase 2 (trackir2winebridge merge):
- [ ] Qt6 compatibility maintained
- [ ] Wayland support enhanced
- [ ] Build compatibility across distributions
- [ ] All features working together

### After Phase 3 (Final integration):
- [ ] Complete, unified codebase
- [ ] All features tested and working
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Ready for main branch promotion

## üìä Expected Outcome

### Unified Main Branch Features:
1. **Complete Qt5 Migration**: All components migrated to Qt5
2. **Professional Installation**: Enterprise-grade installation system
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full testing and verification framework
4. **Qt6 Compatibility**: Forward compatibility with Qt6
5. **Enhanced Wayland Support**: Modern display server support
6. **Cross-Distribution Support**: Ubuntu, Debian, and other distributions
7. **Complete Documentation**: Installation, usage, and troubleshooting guides

## üöÄ Next Steps After Merge

1. **Promote to Main**: Rename `feature/usb-modernization-safe` to `main`
2. **Create Release**: Tag the unified codebase as a release
3. **Update Documentation**: Final documentation updates
4. **Distribution**: Prepare for distribution and user adoption
