> ⚠️ Repository migrated to GitLab: [GitLab: fwfa123/linuxtrackx-ir](https://gitlab.com/fwfa123/linuxtrackx-ir). All new issues and feature requests should be opened on GitLab.

> **Note**: This version (0.99.24) continues development on GitLab. Please file issues and feature requests on GitLab.

### Important upgrade notice for v0.99.24
- Due to significant updates to the testers and Wine Bridge runtime, you should:
  - Reinstall TrackIR firmware and MFC42 runtime
  - Reinstall the Wine Bridge into every Wine/Proton prefix where you previously installed it

Steps (recommended via GUI):
- Open LinuxTrack X-IR v0.99.23 → Gaming tab
- Under Prerequisites: click Install/Repair for TrackIR firmware and MFC42
- Reinstall Wine Bridge per platform:
  - Steam (Proton): click Steam (Proton) and follow the installer
  - Lutris: click Lutris and follow the installer
  - Custom Prefix: click Custom Prefix, select your WINEPREFIX, and follow the installer

This ensures updated testers and runtime files are deployed in each prefix.

LinuxTrack X-IR is a modern fork of the original LinuxTrack project, providing enhanced head tracking support for Linux systems with TrackIR devices.

### Why the **X** in the name?  I am concentrating on TrackIR support and I do not 
have a Mac and other items I am not supporting these at this time, although the code 
reamains embedded.

Lots left TODO  (https://github.com/fwfa123/linuxtrackx-ir/blob/main/docs/progress/TODO_FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT.md)
## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Recommended: AppImage Installation (Easiest)**
```bash
# Download and run the latest AppImage
chmod +x LinuxTrack-X-IR-*.AppImage
./LinuxTrack-X-IR-*.AppImage
```

### **Alternative: Build from Source**
Choose your distribution below for detailed instructions.

## 📦 Installation Options

### **Option 1: AppImage (Recommended for most users)**
- ✅ **No dependencies to install** - Everything included
- ✅ **Works on any Linux distribution** - Universal compatibility
- ✅ **Easy updates** - Just download new AppImage
- ✅ **No system modifications** - Runs from any location

```bash

# For X11 (recommended)
./LinuxTrack-X-IR-*.AppImage

# For Wayland (force X11 compatibility)
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ./LinuxTrack-X-IR-*.AppImage
```

### **Option 2: Build from Source**

#### **Debian / Ubuntu / MX Linux**
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y build-essential autoconf automake libtool qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qttools5-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libopencv-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libmxml-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev bison flex nsis gcc-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libv4l-dev wine-staging

# Build and install (includes 32-bit runtime for Wine Tester.exe)
git clone <repository-url>
cd linuxtrackx-ir
cd scripts/dev && ./wine_dev_setup.sh && cd ../..
autoreconf -fiv
# Enable 32-bit linuxtrack runtime so 32-bit Tester.exe works
# This installs liblinuxtrack.so.0 to /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/linuxtrack
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-lib32-dir=i386-linux-gnu --enable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

# Verify both runtimes installed
file /usr/lib/linuxtrack/liblinuxtrack.so.0 || true
file /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/linuxtrack/liblinuxtrack.so.0 || true

```

#### **Fedora / RHEL / CentOS**
```bash
# Install core dependencies
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ make autoconf automake libtool qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qttools-devel qt5-qtx11extras-devel opencv-devel libusb1-devel mxml-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel bison flex mingw-nsis-base glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 libv4l-devel liblo-devel wine-staging

# Additional 32-bit development packages (may be needed for full functionality)
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++.i686 zlib-ng-compat-devel.i686 libusb1-devel.i686 mxml-devel.i686 libv4l-devel.i686

# Build and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd linuxtrackx-ir
cd scripts/dev && ./wine_dev_setup.sh && cd ../..
autoreconf -fiv
# Enable 32-bit runtime (Fedora multiarch lib dir is /usr/lib)
./configure --prefix=/usr --with-lib32-dir=lib --enable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

```

**Fedora-Specific Notes:**
- **32-bit Support**: The `--enable-ltr-32lib-on-x64` option enables 32-bit library building, which requires the additional 32-bit development packages listed above
- **Qt5 Path Issues**: If you encounter Qt5 path errors, the symlink `/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake -> /usr/lib64/qt5/bin/qmake` may need to be created
- **Wine Bridge**: The Wine bridge components may show compilation warnings but don't affect core LinuxTrack functionality
- **Package Updates**: Fedora package names may change between versions - use `dnf search` to find current package names if installation fails

#### **Fedora-Specific Troubleshooting**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `fatal error: bits/c++config.h: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit C++ development packages: `sudo dnf install gcc-c++.i686` |
| `cannot find -lz: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit zlib development: `sudo dnf install zlib-ng-compat-devel.i686` |
| `cannot find -lmxml: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit mxml development: `sudo dnf install mxml-devel.i686` |
| `cannot find -lusb-1.0: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit libusb development: `sudo dnf install libusb1-devel.i686` |
| `cannot find -lv4l2: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit v4l development: `sudo dnf install libv4l-devel.i686` |
| `i386:x86-64 architecture of input file is incompatible` | This is fixed by the additional 32-bit packages above |
| Qt5 qmake not found | Create symlink: `sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/qt5/bin/qmake /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake` |
| Wine bridge compilation errors | These don't affect core functionality - LinuxTrack will work without Wine bridge |
| **Build succeeds but Wine bridge fails** | **This is normal** - core LinuxTrack functionality is intact |

**Quick Fix for Common Fedora Issues:**
```bash
# If you encounter missing library errors during build
sudo dnf install -y gcc-c++.i686 zlib-ng-compat-devel.i686 libusb1-devel.i686 mxml-devel.i686 libv4l-devel.i686

# If Qt5 qmake is not found
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/qt5/bin
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/qt5/bin/qmake /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
```

#### **Arch Linux / Manjaro**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Arch Linux users may encounter 32-bit library issues during build. See the troubleshooting section below for the complete solution.**

#### **Method 1: Automated Build Script (Recommended)**
```bash
./scripts/build_arch_linux.sh
```

#### **Method 2: Manual Build with 32-bit Library Fix**
This method addresses the common 32-bit library issues on Arch Linux:

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `winegcc: command not found` | Install Wine development tools: `sudo apt install wine-devel` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install wine-devel` (Fedora) or `sudo pacman -S wine` (Arch) |
| `bits/libc-header-start.h: No such file or directory` | Install 32-bit headers: `sudo apt install gcc-multilib libc6-dev-i386` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install glibc-devel.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686` (Fedora) or `sudo pacman -S lib32-glibc lib32-gcc-libs` (Arch) |
| MFC42 installation fails | Use the built-in MFC42 installer in the GUI, or manually run `winetricks mfc42`. The enhanced debugging will show detailed output and automatically try `winetricks vcrun6` as fallback |
| GUI not displaying on Wayland | Force X11 compatibility: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb ltr_gui` |
| Permission denied on device | Add user to required groups: `sudo usermod -a -G plugdev,input $USER` |
| Application not appearing in launcher | Use `--prefix=/usr/local` instead of `/opt` during installation |
| Firmware extraction fails | Run `./scripts/wine_check.sh` to diagnose Wine issues |

### Fedora/Nobara Notes (winetricks)

- Install prerequisites:
```bash
sudo dnf install winetricks cabextract wine
```

- Verify winetricks availability:
```bash
which winetricks
winetricks --version
```

- If launching the GUI from a desktop icon, the environment PATH may exclude `/usr/bin`. Launch from a terminal, or ensure `/usr/bin` is present in PATH, then retry the MFC42 installation in the GUI.

- Flatpak/sandboxed environments: the app can use host tools. Verify host winetricks with:
```bash
flatpak-spawn --host which winetricks
```

### **Arch Linux Troubleshooting**

#### **32-bit Library Issues (Most Common Problem)**

**Problem:** Build fails with errors like:
```
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lltr: No such file or directory
/usr/bin/ld: .libs/libltr_la-cal.o: file class ELFCLASS32 incompatible with ELFCLASS64
```

**Root Cause:** LinuxTrack requires 32-bit versions of some libraries for Wine bridge compatibility, but these are not available in the official Arch repositories:
- `lib32-mxml` (Mini-XML library)
- `lib32-liblo` (Open Sound Control library)

**Solution:** Use the automated 32-bit library build script:
```bash
# Run the automated script to build and install missing 32-bit libraries
./scripts/build_32bit_libs.sh

# Then build LinuxTrack with explicit 64-bit flags
CFLAGS="-m64" CXXFLAGS="-m64" LDFLAGS="-m64" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
make -j$(nproc)
```

**What the script does:**
- Downloads source code for both missing libraries
- Builds 32-bit versions with proper compiler flags
- Installs to `/usr/lib32/` with correct symlinks
- Uses parallel compilation for speed
- Cleans up build files automatically

#### **Common Arch Linux Wine Issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `wine-staging` conflicts with `wine-stable` | Remove conflicting packages: `sudo pacman -R wine-staging wine-gecko wine-mono winetricks` |
| `lib32-unixodbc` not found | This package doesn't exist in Arch. Remove it from PKGBUILD dependencies |
| Wine build takes hours | Use optimized builds with parallel compilation: `make -j$(nproc)` |
| Missing Wine dependencies | Install complete suite: `wine-stable`, `wine-stable-mono`, `wine-gecko` |
| Wine bridge not working | Ensure wine-stable is installed, not wine-staging |
| Orphaned packages after Wine removal | Clean up: `sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)` |
| **Missing 32-bit libraries (liblo, mxml)** | **Use the automated build script: `./scripts/build_32bit_libs.sh`** |
| **32-bit/64-bit compilation conflicts** | **Use explicit 64-bit flags: `CFLAGS="-m64" CXXFLAGS="-m64" LDFLAGS="-m64"`** |
| **Qt5 Makefile not generated** | **Manually generate: `cd src/qt_gui && /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 -spec linux-g++ "LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/linuxtrack" ltr_gui.pro`** |

#### **32-bit Runtime Verification**
```bash
# After install from source
file /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/linuxtrack/liblinuxtrack.so.0

# After running AppImage
ls -l squashfs-root/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/linuxtrack/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### **Build System Issues:**

**Problem:** Configure script sets 32-bit flags even when disabled
**Solution:** Use explicit 64-bit flags during configure:
```bash
CFLAGS="-m64" CXXFLAGS="-m64" LDFLAGS="-m64" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
```

**Problem:** Qt5 Makefile not generated automatically
**Solution:** Manually generate the Makefile:
```bash
cd src/qt_gui
/usr/bin/qmake-qt5 -spec linux-g++ "LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/linuxtrack" ltr_gui.pro
```

#### **Verification Steps:**

After building, verify the installation:
```bash
# Check if 32-bit libraries are installed
ls -la /usr/lib32/libmxml* /usr/lib32/liblo*

# Check if LinuxTrack binaries are built
ls -la src/qt_gui/ltr_gui
ls -la src/mickey/mickey

# Test Wine bridge components
ls -la src/wine_bridge/client/NPClient*.so
ls -la src/wine_bridge/client/FreeTrackClient*.so
```

#### **Automated Scripts for Arch Linux**

**`scripts/build_32bit_libs.sh`** - Automated 32-bit library builder
- **Purpose:** Builds missing 32-bit libraries (`lib32-mxml`, `lib32-liblo`) for Arch Linux
- **Usage:** `./scripts/build_32bit_libs.sh`
- **Features:**
  - Downloads latest source code for both libraries
  - Uses proper 32-bit compiler flags (`-m32`)
  - Installs to correct locations (`/usr/lib32/`)
  - Creates necessary symlinks
  - Uses parallel compilation for speed
  - Cleans up build files automatically

**`scripts/lib32-mxml.PKGBUILD`** - PKGBUILD template for AUR
- **Purpose:** Template for creating AUR packages for 32-bit libraries
- **Usage:** Copy to AUR package directory and customize
- **Features:** Follows Arch Linux 32-bit package guidelines

**`docs/ARCH_LINUX_32BIT_LIBRARIES.md`** - Detailed guide
- **Purpose:** Complete manual for building 32-bit libraries
- **Contents:** Step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting, AUR package creation

#### **Missing 32-bit Libraries Solution:**
If you encounter "skipping incompatible" errors for `liblo` or `mxml`, these 32-bit libraries are not available in the official repos or AUR. Use the automated build script:

```bash
# Build missing 32-bit libraries
./scripts/build_32bit_libs.sh

# Then try building LinuxTrack again
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-ltr-32lib-on-x64
make -j$(nproc)
```

This script will:
- Download and build 32-bit versions of `mxml` and `liblo`
- Install them to `/usr/lib32/`
- Create necessary symlinks
- Clean up build files automatically
```

### **Enhanced MFC42 Debugging** 🔍
The latest version includes comprehensive debugging for MFC42 winetricks installation:

- **Winetricks Version Check** - Verifies winetricks functionality before installation
- **Environment Setup** - Forces 32-bit wine prefix (`WINEARCH=win32`) for optimal compatibility
- **Comprehensive Output Capture** - Shows detailed winetricks output for troubleshooting
- **Automatic Fallback** - If `winetricks mfc42` fails, automatically tries `winetricks vcrun6`
- **File System Inspection** - Uses `find` and `ls` commands to verify installed files
- **Progress Updates** - Real-time feedback during long-running installations

**Debugging Output Includes:**
- Winetricks version and functionality test
- Wine prefix creation and environment setup
- Complete winetricks command output
- File system inspection of installed DLLs
